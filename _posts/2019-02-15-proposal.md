# [Project B - Proposal]({% post_url 2019-02-15-proposal %})

## Topic - Vue.js
The topic for my Project B is Vue.js, also known as Vue which is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. I am using Vue for my Project 2. So, in order to enhance my skill set and really understand and experiment with this language, i choose to go ahead with Vue.

## Project - A Game
In this tutorial, i will develop a small fight game(without character visuals) against a monster using pure Vue. However, in case i have more time to work, i'll also develop a Quotes web app in which we can post our quotes.

## Deliverables
For the game users can:-
* Start a new game
* Attack
* Special Attack
* Heal
* Give Up

For the quote app users can:-
* Post a quote
* Delete a quote

I am using safari books to learn vue and it has these projects in it. However, i'll try to make modifications to make it better. Here is the [link](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/videos/vue-js-2/9781788992817) to the safari course.
