# [ Final Report ]({% post_url 2019-02-01-finalreport %})

## Overall Progress
Talking about my overall progress, i took a much bigger project than the time alotted but somehow, i think, i was for the best as i learned a lot more than would have if i had chosen a basic tiny project. Fortunately, i finished about 70% of the project that i aspired to.

## Lessons Learned
Django really makes apps simple to develop and manage. Also i learned some recommended ways to do code. I lost my project due to technical issued in my mac os but as i was using GitHub, i easily recovered. I also got better at jQuery during the project development.

## Future Work
I think i can start building basic webapps now. However as a lot of big companies like Instagram are using this, so, i can confidently say that Django will rise even more in the near future
