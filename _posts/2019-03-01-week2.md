# [ Week 2 ]({% post_url 2019-03-01-week2 %})

## Accomplishments:
I watched basic tutorials from Vueschool and vuemastery websites to get a better understanding and moved to my main tutorial. I learned basic components and various vue directives like v-if, v-on and v-bind that really makes vue stand apart from other frameworks. I also learned about two way binding and computed properties and methods.

## Roadblocks:
Until now i didn't faced much roadblocks as i was covering the basics and moving forward.

## Plan for next week:
I am going to start the development of my application, use all the things that i have learned until now.

## Still needs to be done:
* Creating Github repository
* Development
* Tutorial
