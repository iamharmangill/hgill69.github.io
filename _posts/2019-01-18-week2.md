# [ Week 2 ]({% post_url 2019-01-18-week2 %})

## Accomplishments:-
  Beginning this week i installed django on my system and started learning about the basic syntax and templates. I learned about the models, urls and forms. At the very beginning, i found Django quite difficult. But as i am moving ahead with the course, i am learning that inspite of the its complexity that one faces, it really makes web development quite interactive and fast.
  
I have learned about creating views, templates and dynamic url routing and validation. i have started the development of my project and i have already created a basic view to login via django admin and creating new tweets.

## Roadblocks:-
 Being a very different framework from other languages i have learned before, i have a hard time figuring things out and resolve errors that i face.
 
 
## Plan for the Next Week:-
For the next week, i will add the function for deleting and updating tweets. I will also integrate bootstrap to create a homepage and create tweets from there. Also i will start playing with the Django Rest framework.

## Still Needs to be done:-
* Proper Pages
* Implenting Search
* Bootstrap
and much more.
