# [ Week 3 ]({% post_url 2019-01-25-week3 %})

## Accomplishments:-
  I have created a basic working prototype for the tweetme. I have successfully installed Django Rest Framework. I have also used some Bootstrap to make my website more appealing and responsive.

## Roadblocks:-
  Resolving of error being the biggest roadblock. As my tutorial guide has used older versions of Django and Django Rest Framework, so i get various erorrs and it takes a long time to resolve them. However, i also feel, i took upon a large project as compared to the time alloted.
 
 
## Plan for the Next Week:-
For the next week, i will be playing with AJAX and jquery to add more functionality to my website and to finish my project.

## Still Needs to be done:-
* AJAX
* jQuery
* User Profile
* Likes and Replies
